# Introduction :    🩺

<p>Alzvision is a simple web interface that leverages the power of deep learning model and classifies neuroimages according to the stage of alzheimer's disease.</p><br>

#  Problem Statement :       ✍🏻

<p>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and irreversible neurological disorder that affects a growing number of older adults worldwide, leading to significant personal and societal burden. Early detection of the disease is critical for providing timely treatment and support for patients and their families. While medical imaging techniques such as MRI can provide valuable information about brain structure, accurately detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease from these images is a challenging task. Therefore, there is a need for advanced deep learning models like Xception to analyze medical imaging data and improve the accuracy of early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease </p>
<br/>

# Proposed solution :     🛠 
<p>The solution we propose is to create a web application that analyses brain scan images and predicts the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease using a deep learning model.The application will have a user-friendly interface with four main elements: general information about Alzheimer's disease, prediction,diagnosis based information and nearby hospitals.</p> 
 <p>The solution flow is as follows :</p> 
 
# Solution Flow :     ⏬
<li>The user interacts with the UI to choose an image.</li>
<li>The chosen image is processed by a Xception deep learning model.</li>
<li>The Xception model is integrated with a Flask application.</li>
<li>The Xception model analyzes the image and generates predictions.</li>
<li>The predictions are displayed on the Flask UI for the user to see.</li>
<li>This process enables users to input an image and receive accurate predictions quickly.</li>

# Value for Environment :   🏞

<p>While the project primarily focuses on medical research and healthcare applications related to Alzheimer's disease, it does not directly have an impact on the environment. The environmental value may arise indirectly through improved healthcare practices, which can potentially lead to more efficient resource allocation and reduced environmental impact in healthcare facilities. However, the primary value of the project lies in the medical domain and its societal implications.</p>
